Solutions to problems offered by the USACO training pages. 

Problems are chiefly solved in C++, though Python acts as a substitute when input is a bit of an issue. 

Please keep in mind that these solutions are not here to be copied. If you must, briefly scan the solution for a hint.

Some of the programs are documented.
