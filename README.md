# Recreational 
Some solutions for contest/recreational programming problems written since late 2016.

Only the first 100 Project Euler problems are in this repository.

> We hope that you enjoyed solving this problem. Please do not deprive others of going through the same process by publishing your solution outside of Project Euler. Members found to be spoiling problems beyond #100 will have their accounts locked (see note).
